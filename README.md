## Files Description
* **demo.py:** This .py file is based on the Colab Notebook of Detecton2. It only contains the code of predicted part. After building, you can run this file to check whether Detectron2 can work or not.  
* **HW3_train.py:** It contains training part and validation part. You can tune some hyperparameters here. Amd make sure the file path is modified correctly by you.  
* **HW3_test.py:** It contains testing part.
## Reproducing Submission
To reproduce my submission without retraining, do the following steps:   
#### 1. Install detectron2
  The uploaded files do not contain Detectron2. You should build Detectron2 first. If your OS is linux, follow Detecron2 GitHub directly. If your OS is win10, you can follow the "Findings or Summary". Those steps is basically from conansherry's GitHub. I just change a little bit to get work on my computer. After building Detectron2, place the files of this repository into Detectron2 main folder.
#### 2. Prepare testing data
